# Pig Game
This is my first ever side project in Javascript! I followed Jonas Schmedtmann's
tutorial to build this: [The Complete JavaScript Course 2018](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/)

## Game rules

The game has 2 players. Each round, the player rolls the dice as many times as they want.
Each result gets added your round score. However, you lose all your round score points if you
roll a 1. It will then be the next player's turn. 

You can choose to 'hold' your points, which means the round score gets added to your global
score. 

First player to reach 100 points (total score) wins the game!
